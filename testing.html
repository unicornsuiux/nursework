    <p> INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT This INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT (this &ldquo;ICA&rdquo;) is entered into
        by the undersigned contractor (&ldquo;you&rdquo;) and iNursellent Inc. d/b/a iNursellent
        (&ldquo;iNursellent&rdquo;). You and iNursellent may be referred to, individually, as a &ldquo;Party&rdquo; and,
        collectively, as the &ldquo;Parties.&rdquo; This ICA, together with iNursellent&rsquo;s Terms of Service and
        Privacy Policy (collectively with this ICA, this &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;), governs your access to
        iNursellent&rsquo;s technology platform and applications (collectively, the &ldquo;Marketplace&rdquo;) that,
        among other things, may allow you to view and sign up to work certain international Nursing job assignments
        posted at workplaces (each, a &ldquo;Workplace&rdquo;) owned and/or operated by iNursellent&rsquo;s third-party
        clients (each, a &ldquo;Client&rdquo;), as well as any services that you provide to those Clients
        (&ldquo;Contracted Services&rdquo;). PLEASE REVIEW THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. IN PARTICULAR, YOUR ATTENTION IS
        DIRECTED TO THE MUTUAL ARBITRATION PROVISION IN SECTION 12, AS IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO RESOLVE DISPUTES ON AN
        INDIVIDUAL BASIS, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION. BY SIGNING THIS
        ICA, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD ALL OF THE TERMS, INCLUDING SECTION 12, AND HAVE TAKEN
        THE TIME AND SOUGHT ANY ASSISTANCE NEEDED TO COMPREHEND THE CONSEQUENCES OF ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT. 1.
        Relationship of the Parties. 1. You are an independent contractor, and this Agreement shall not be construed to
        create any association, partnership, joint venture, employment, or agency relationship between you and
        iNursellent or any Client, for any purpose. You have no authority (and shall not hold yourself out as having
        authority) to make or accept any agreements or representations on behalf of iNursellent or any Client. 2.
        Without limiting Section 1(a), you shall not be eligible to participate in any vacation, group medical or life
        insurance, disability, profit sharing or retirement benefits, or any other fringe benefits or benefit plans
        offered by iNursellent to its employees, and iNursellent will not be responsible for withholding or paying any
        income, payroll, Social Security, or other federal, state, or local taxes, making any insurance contributions,
        including for unemployment or disability, or obtaining workers&rsquo; compensation insurance on your behalf. You
        shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify iNursellent against liability for any such taxes or contributions
        that you fail to pay, including penalties and interest. 3. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) the Parties
        operate separate and distinct business enterprises that each provides a service outside the usual course of
        business of the other; (ii) you are customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or
        business of the same nature as any Contracted Services that you provide to Clients under this Agreement, and
        plan to continue to engage in that trade, occupation, or business regardless of whether this Agreement remains
        in effect; and (iii) this Agreement and your use of the Marketplace shall not prevent you from engaging in any
        other business trade, commercial activity, or provision of services to any third party. 2. Viewing and Booking
        International Nurse Job Assignments. 1. iNursellent will endeavor to make the Marketplace accessible to you,
        and, subject to Section 2(b), below, present you with open international Nursing job assignments, if any, that
        match the qualifications you share with iNursellent. You are not required to book any particular international
        Nursing job assignment available through the Marketplace, or any international Nursing job assignments at all,
        and you acknowledge and agree that there will be no consequences for your decision not to do so. 2. iNursellent
        has sole discretion as to which, if any, international Nursing job assignments to present to you. You further
        acknowledge and agree that iNursellent, in the exercise of its discretion, may honor do-not-return requests from
        Clients which could result in international Nursing job assignments being hidden from you or otherwise made
        unavailable. 3. To the extent that you book a international Nursing job assignment presented to you through the
        Marketplace, you authorize iNursellent to communicate with both you and the corresponding Client about the
        international Nursing job assignment and to establish and facilitate direct communication between you and that
        Client. 3. Performance of Contracted Services. 1. iNursellent shall not control or direct the manner or means by
        which you perform any Contracted Services, including but not limited to, the time, place, or manner in which you
        perform such services for Clients, which will be based solely on your independent professional judgment. 2. You
        shall furnish, at your own expense, the materials, equipment, supplies, and other resources necessary to perform
        any Contracted Services, except to the extent that a Client, in its sole discretion, elects to furnish any of
        the foregoing. 3. You shall comply with all lawful third-party access rules and procedures communicated to you
        in writing by Clients or on their behalf, including those related to safety, security, and confidentiality. You
        acknowledge and agree that any such rules and procedures are determined solely by Clients, not by iNursellent.
        4. Payment. 1. In consideration of using our platform, you agree to pay us the terms stated in the Marketplace
        listing for each job position. You acknowledge that you shall be solely responsible for all applicable federal,
        state, and local taxes, as set out in Section 1(b), above. 2. Unless otherwise expressly agreed to between you
        and any Client for which you perform Contracted Services, you are solely responsible for any travel or other
        costs or expenses incurred by you in connection with the performance of such services, and in no event shall
        iNursellent reimburse you for any such costs or expenses. 3. iNursellent will make any payments due to you for
        working a international Nursing job assignment under this Agreement within seven (7) days of receiving
        confirmation from you and the corresponding Client, to the reasonable satisfaction of iNursellent, that you
        worked the international Nursing job assignment. Payments will be made using the Stripe platform, or by such
        other means as iNursellent may, in its reasonable discretion, specify. You acknowledge and agree that: (i)
        receiving payment from iNursellent may require you to open an account with Stripe; (ii) Stripe may impose
        additional terms, conditions, and/or fees in connection with the opening and maintenance of such accounts; and
        (iii) iNursellent and/or Stripe may impose additional terms, conditions, and/or fees in connection with the
        expedited withdrawal of funds from your Stripe account. 5. Term and Termination. 1. The term of this Agreement
        shall commence on the date you sign and shall continue until terminated as provided herein (the
        &ldquo;Term&rdquo;). 2. You acknowledge and agree that iNursellent has no obligation to provide, or continue to
        provide, the Marketplace in any specific location or territory. iNursellent reserves the right to, in its sole
        discretion, suspend or terminate your access to the Marketplace at any time or for any reason. Likewise, you may
        suspend or terminate your use of the Marketplace at any time and for any reason. If you wish to deactivate your
        account, please contact iNursellent&rsquo;s customer support. 3. The following provisions shall survive
        termination of this Agreement: Section 9 (Confidentiality), Section 11 (Indemnification), Section 12 (Mutual
        Arbitration), Section 13 (Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and Venue), and Section 14 (Miscellaneous). 6. Your
        Representations, Warranties, and Covenants. You represent, warrant, and covenant to iNursellent that: 1. you
        have the right to enter into this Agreement, to grant the rights granted in this Agreement, and to perform fully
        all of your obligations in this Agreement; 2. your entering into this Agreement with iNursellent and your
        performance of Contracted Services as contemplated herein does not and will not conflict with or result in any
        breach or default under any other agreement to which you are subject; 3. you have the skill, experience, and
        qualifications, including, without limitation, all licenses, permits, and registrations required to perform any
        Contracted Services you undertake to render pursuant to this Agreement; 4. all information that you provide to
        iNursellent will be true and accurate; 5. you will promptly notify iNursellent in writing if: (i) any
        information you have provided iNursellent becomes inaccurate or requires updating; (ii) you become subject to
        any disciplinary and/or revocation proceeding related to any license, permit, or registration required to
        perform any Contracted Services you undertake to render pursuant to this Agreement, or if any such license,
        permit, or registration expires, is revoked, is abandoned, or otherwise becomes inoperative; or (iii) you are
        charged with or convicted of any misdemeanor or felony involving fraud, controlled substances, moral turpitude,
        or any act of physical violence; and 6. you, and not iNursellent, shall be responsible for maintaining books and
        records related to your separate and distinct business enterprise, including, without limitation, any Contracted
        Services that you perform. 7. iNursellent&rsquo;s Representations and Warranties. iNursellent represents and
        warrants to you that: 1. it has the full right, power, and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform
        its obligations hereunder; and 2. the execution of this Agreement by its representative, whose signature is set
        forth at the end of this Agreement, has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action. 8. Intellectual
        Property Rights and Licenses. 1. All copyright, database rights, trademarks (whether registered or
        unregistered), design rights (whether registered or unregistered), patent applications, patents, and other
        intellectual property rights of any nature in the Marketplace, together with the underlying software code and
        any and all rights in, or derived from the Marketplace are proprietary and owned either directly by iNursellent
        or by iNursellent&rsquo;s licensors and are protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws. You
        agree that you will not use such proprietary information, materials, or intellectual property rights in any way
        whatsoever except for use of the Marketplace in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. No portion of the
        Marketplace may be reproduced in any form or by any means, and you agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan, sell,
        distribute, exploit, or create derivative works based on the Marketplace or its contents. 2. You acknowledge and
        agree that any questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, feedback, or other information (collectively,
        &ldquo;Submissions&rdquo;) that you provide to iNursellent regarding the Marketplace or any Client are provided
        freely and shall become the sole property of iNursellent. iNursellent shall own exclusive rights of such
        Submissions, including all intellectual property rights therein, and shall be entitled to the unrestricted use
        and dissemination of these Submissions for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment or
        compensation to you. 9. Confidentiality. 1. You acknowledge and agree that you may have access to information
        that is treated as confidential and proprietary by iNursellent, its affiliates, and its Clients, including,
        without limitation, trade secrets, technology, and information pertaining to business operations and strategies,
        customers, pricing, marketing, finances, sourcing, personnel, patients, or operations, in each case whether
        spoken, written, printed, electronic, or in any other form or medium (collectively, the &ldquo;Confidential
        Information&rdquo;). 2. Subject to Section 9(d) and Section 9(e), below, you agree to treat all Confidential
        Information as strictly confidential, not to disclose Confidential Information or permit it to be disclosed, in
        whole or part, to any third party without the prior written consent of iNursellent and the applicable Client in
        each instance, and not to use any Confidential Information for any purpose except as required in the performance
        of the Contracted Services pursuant to this Agreement. You shall notify iNursellent immediately in the event you
        become aware of any loss or unauthorized disclosure of any Confidential Information. 3. You acknowledge and
        agree you are required to abide by all local, state, and federal regulations concerning the confidentiality of
        records and individually identifiable health information to the extent applicable, including, without
        limitation, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Health Information Technology
        for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH), and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Violation of
        this provision will constitute a material breach of this Agreement. 4. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
        construed to prevent disclosure of Confidential Information as required by applicable law or regulation, or
        pursuant to the valid order of a court of competent jurisdiction or an authorized government agency, provided
        that the disclosure does not exceed the extent of disclosure required by such law, regulation, or order. You
        agree to provide written notice of any such order, or any proceeding that could reasonably result in such an
        order, to iNursellent within two (2) business days of receiving such order, but in any event sufficiently in
        advance of making any disclosure to permit iNursellent to contest the order or seek confidentiality protections,
        as determined in iNursellent&rsquo;s sole discretion. 5. Notice of Immunity Under the Defend Trade Secrets Act
        of 2016 (DTSA). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, you will not be held criminally or
        civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for any disclosure of a trade secret that: (i) is
        made: (A) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to
        an attorney; and (B) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (ii)
        is made in a complaint or other document that is filed under seal in a lawsuit or other proceeding. If you file
        a lawsuit alleging retaliation by iNursellent for reporting a suspected violation of law, you may disclose
        iNursellent&rsquo;s trade secrets to your attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding
        if you file any document containing the trade secret under seal and do not disclose the trade secret, except
        pursuant to court order. 10. Insurance. 1. Throughout the Term, you shall maintain, at your own expense, current
        insurance, in amounts and of types required by law to provide any Contracted Services and cover you during your
        performance of such services. You further agree to provide to iNursellent, upon request, current certificates of
        insurance documenting any coverage required by this Section 10(a), and to promptly notify iNursellent in writing
        if any insurance policy providing such coverage expires, is canceled, or is not renewed, or if the
        policy&rsquo;s underwriter informs you of its intent to cancel or not renew the policy. 2. You agree to maintain
        sufficient insurance to cover any risks or claims arising out of or related to your relationship with
        iNursellent, including workers&rsquo; compensation insurance where required by law. You acknowledge and
        understand that you will not be eligible for workers&rsquo; compensation benefits through iNursellent and are
        instead responsible for maintaining your own workers&rsquo; compensation insurance or occupational accident
        insurance. Maintenance of your own workers&rsquo; compensation insurance or occupational accident insurance will
        not disqualify you from participating in any occupational accident insurance policy, which iNursellent, in its
        sole discretion, may make available to you. 11. Indemnification. You shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless
        iNursellent and its affiliates, together their respective equity holders, officers, directors, employees,
        agents, successors, and assigns from and against all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, actions,
        judgments, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind (including reasonable
        attorneys&rsquo; fees) arising out of or resulting from: (a) your performance of any Contracted Services,
        including, without limitation, bodily injury or death of any person, or damage to real or tangible personal
        property resulting from your acts or omissions; or (b) your breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or
        obligation under this Agreement. 12. Mutual Arbitration. 1. Agreement to Arbitrate. You and iNursellent agree
        that, except as provided below, any dispute, controversy, or claim arising, or that has arisen, out of or
        relating in any way to this Agreement, any breach or termination of this Agreement, your relationship with
        iNursellent, and/or any Contracted Services you provide under this Agreement (a &ldquo;Claim&rdquo;) will be
        determined by binding arbitration or in small claims court. This agreement to arbitrate does not cover any
        claims that cannot be compelled to arbitration as a matter of applicable law, including certain administrative
        claims with local, state, or federal government agencies. In addition, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed
        to excuse a Party from bringing an administrative claim before any agency in order to fulfill the Party&rsquo;s
        obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration. Notwithstanding the above,
        to the extent a Party wishes to pursue a Claim after the administrative proceedings have concluded (or wishes to
        appeal an administrative decision), and those further proceedings would ordinarily be heard in a court, the
        Party must resolve those further proceedings through arbitration or in small claims court under this Agreement,
        and not in state or federal court. The Parties understand and fully agree that by entering into this Agreement
        to arbitrate they are giving up their right to have a trial by jury, and are giving up their normal rights of
        appeal following the rendering of a decision except as applicable law provides for judicial review of
        arbitration proceedings. The Parties anticipate that by entering into this Agreement, they will gain the
        benefits of a speedy and less expensive dispute resolution procedure. The Parties agree that the U.S. Federal
        Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This arbitration
        provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and/or the termination of your relationship with
        iNursellent. 2. Class, Collective, and Representative Action Waiver. The Parties agree that each may bring
        Claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any
        purported class, collective, consolidated or representative proceeding, except as otherwise provided under
        applicable law. The Parties waive the right to assert, participate in, or receive money or any other relief from
        any class, representative, or collective claims against each other in court, arbitration, or any other
        proceeding. Each Party shall only submit their own individual claims against the other and will not seek to
        represent the interests of any other person. The Arbitrator shall have no jurisdiction or authority to
        adjudicate any class, representative, or collective claim, or to consolidate different arbitration proceedings
        with or join any other Party to an arbitration between the Parties. To the extent that the Arbitrator finds that
        any Claim is non-arbitrable or must proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, that
        Claim must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the Parties agree
        that litigation of those Claims shall be stayed, and any applicable statutes of limitations tolled, pending the
        outcome of any individual Claims in arbitration. 3. Notice of Claim. Before electing to seek arbitration or
        filing in small claims court, a Party must give the other Party written notice of any Claim within the
        applicable statute of limitations for the type of Claim(s) asserted (the &ldquo;Notice of Claim&rdquo;). Any
        Notice of Claim provided to iNursellent by you must be sent to iNursellent, 825 Watters Creek, Suite 250, Allen
        TX 75013. Any Notice of Claim provided to you by iNursellent will be sent to your current residential address on
        file with iNursellent. The Notice of Claim must identify and describe the nature of all Claims asserted and the
        facts upon which such Claims are based. The Parties agree that, after a Notice of Claim is sent but before
        either you or iNursellent initiate arbitration or file a claim in small claims court against the other, we will
        personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to
        resolve informally any Claim covered by this Agreement. You agree to participate in the conference personally,
        and iNursellent agrees to have a company representative participate in the conference. If either Party is
        represented by counsel with respect to any Notice of Claim, that counsel may participate in the conference as
        well. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the
        informal dispute resolution process required by this paragraph. If the Parties do not reach an agreement to
        resolve the Claim within sixty (60) days after the Notice of Claim is received, you or iNursellent may commence
        an arbitration proceeding by filing a Demand for Arbitration or, alternatively, by filing a Claim in small
        claims court. You agree that you may not commence any arbitration or file a Claim in small claims court unless
        you have complied with this provision and made a good faith effort to resolve your Claim directly with
        iNursellent during that time. 4. Arbitration Procedures. The arbitration will be conducted by the AAA before a
        single AAA Arbitrator under the AAA&rsquo;s rules, which are available at www.adr.org, except as modified by
        this Agreement or otherwise agreed between you and iNursellent. Arbitration shall be held in the county in which
        you have contracted to provide Contracted Services under this Agreement before a single Arbitrator. The
        Arbitrator will be selected using the following procedure: (a) the AAA will send the Parties a list of five
        candidates; (b) if the Parties cannot agree on an arbitrator from the list, each Party shall return its list to
        the AAA within 10 days, striking up to two candidates, and ranking the remaining candidates in order of
        preference; (c) the AAA shall appoint as Arbitrator the candidate with the highest aggregate ranking; and (d) if
        for any reason the appointment cannot be made according to this procedure, the AAA may exercise its discretion
        in appointing the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to
        the validity, enforceability, or scope of this Agreement and the arbitrability of any dispute between the
        Parties. The Arbitrator shall provide the Parties with a reasoned written decision explaining his or her
        findings and conclusions. Any arbitral award determination shall be final and binding upon the Parties and
        subject to judicial review pursuant to the law applicable to judicial review of arbitration proceedings. The
        award shall be binding only among the Parties and shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or
        other proceeding involving a different Party. iNursellent will not seek to recover its attorneys&rsquo; fees and
        costs in arbitration from you unless the Arbitrator finds that either the substance of your Claim or the relief
        sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the
        standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). Judgment on the Arbitrator&rsquo;s award may be
        entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. 5. Small Claims Option. Either you or iNursellent can seek to
        have a Claim resolved in small claims court if all the requirements of the small claims court are satisfied.
        Either you or iNursellent may seek to have a Claim resolved in small claims court in the county in which you
        have contracted to provide Contracted Services under this Agreement, and you may also bring a Claim in small
        claims court in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco. If a Claim qualifies for small claims
        court, but a Party commences an arbitration proceeding, you and iNursellent agree that either Party may elect
        instead to have the Claim resolved in small claims court, and upon written notice of a Party&rsquo;s election,
        the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) will administratively close the arbitration proceeding.
        Any dispute about whether a Claim qualifies for small claims court shall be resolved by that court, not by an
        arbitrator. 6. Relief Available in Arbitration. Unless you or iNursellent seek to have a Claim resolved in small
        claims court, the Arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any Claim asserted by you
        or iNursellent and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual Party seeking
        relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that Party&rsquo;s individual Claim. To
        the extent that either Party prevails on a Claim and seeks public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief
        that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public),
        the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and
        not in arbitration. The Parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed
        pending the outcome of the merits of any individual Claim in arbitration. Before a court of competent
        jurisdiction issues any public injunctive relief, it shall review the factual findings of the arbitration award
        on which any injunction would issue with no deference to the Arbitrator. 7. Arbitration Fees. Payment of all
        filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. You are required to pay the
        AAA&rsquo;s initial filing fee, but iNursellent will reimburse you for this filing fee at the conclusion of the
        arbitration to the extent it exceeds the fee that you would have to pay to file a complaint in federal or state
        court in the county in which you have contracted to provide Contracted Services under this Agreement or in San
        Francisco County, California, whichever amount is greater. If the Arbitrator finds that either your Claim or the
        relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous, was brought for an improper purpose, or otherwise
        violates the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), then the payment of all fees will be
        governed by the AAA Rules and iNursellent will not reimburse your initial filing fee. The Parties agree that the
        AAA has discretion to modify the amount or timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under the AAA
        Rules where it deems appropriate, provided that such modification does not increase the AAA fees to you or
        iNursellent and you and iNursellent waive any objection to such fee modification. 8. Effect of Unenforceability
        or Inapplicability. If any portion of this Section 12 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful in any respect or
        for any reason, or with respect to any particular Claim, then the relevant portion of this Section 12 shall be
        severed from this Agreement. Any such severance shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section
        12, and this Agreement will still be fully enforceable as to any and all Claims, which must be resolved in
        arbitration, unless a Party elects the small claims option under Section 12(e). If Section 12 in its entirety is
        found to be unenforceable, unlawful, or inapplicable for any reason, or with respect to any particular Claim,
        then the subject dispute or Claim shall be governed by the agreement to arbitrate in the most recent prior
        Independent Contractor Agreement between the Parties, to the extent one exists, notwithstanding Section 14(c),
        below. 13. Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and Venue. 1. To the fullest extent allowable by law, this Agreement and
        all related documents, including all schedules attached and all matters arising out of or relating to this
        Agreement and any Contracted Services provided hereunder, whether sounding in contract, tort, or statute, are
        governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware with regard to its conflict of
        laws rules. 2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the dispute resolution process set forth in Section 12, above,
        shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. 3. Except where prohibited by law and except for claims that
        are heard in a small claims court as set forth in Section 12, above, any claims arising out of or relating in
        any way to this Agreement that for whatever reason are not required to be arbitrated or filed in small claims
        court will be litigated exclusively in the state or federal court in Allen, Texas. You and iNursellent all
        consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in San Francisco, California, and waive any claim that such courts
        constitute an inconvenient forum. 14. Miscellaneous. 1. You shall not export, directly or indirectly, any
        technical data acquired from iNursellent, or any products utilizing any such data, to any country in violation
        of any applicable export laws or regulations. 2. Except as explicitly stated otherwise, any notices to
        iNursellent shall be given by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested to iNursellent, 825
        Watters Creek, Suite 250, Allen TX 75013, Attn: Legal Department. All notices to you may be given electronically
        through the Marketplace and/or at the e-mail address you provide to iNursellent. 3. This Agreement, together
        with any other documents incorporated by reference, constitute the sole and entire agreement of the Parties to
        this Agreement with respect to the subject matter contained herein, and, except as otherwise provided in Section
        12(h), above, supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and
        warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter. 4. iNursellent may modify this Agreement
        at any time. If iNursellent makes changes to this Agreement, it will provide you with notice of those changes
        before the revised Agreement becomes effective. If you disagree with the revised Agreement, you may terminate
        the Agreement immediately as provided herein. If you do not terminate the Agreement before the date the revised
        Agreement becomes effective, your continued use of the Marketplace and/or performance of Contracted Services
        under the revised Agreement will constitute acceptance of the revised Agreement. 5. iNursellent may freely
        assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement at any time by written notice to you. You may not assign
        this Agreement without the prior written consent of iNursellent, and any attempt to do so will be void. Subject
        to the limits on assignment stated above, this Agreement will inure to the benefit of, be binding on, and be
        enforceable against each of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 6. Except as
        otherwise provided in Section 12, above, if any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or
        unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other
        term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other
        jurisdiction. 7. No failure or delay on the part of either Party in exercising any right, power or remedy
        hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power
        or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. 8.
        This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts and by electronic signature, each of which shall be
        deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute one instrument. iNursellent Inc. d/b/a iNursellent
